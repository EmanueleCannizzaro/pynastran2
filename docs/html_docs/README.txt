# generate the index.rst file
# and the root directory
sphinx-quickstart.exe

# no idea...
sphinx-apidoc.exe -d 4 -o index -V 0.9.0 -H pyNastran -A SteveDoyle ../pyNastran


# the original index folder was autogenerated
# this one is done is done with a script that can
# be customized b/c I don't know how to create the
# original
#
# note this script also deletes folders in order
# to prevent unwanted files/directories from being
# made into html
#
# This isn't really a big deal since this we have
# git.
python makeIndex.py


# does the same thing...
sphinx-apidoc -o output ../pyNastran


# final command
make html > make.out 2>&1

# does basically the same thing, but is more obvious...
# sphinx-build -v -w warnings.out -d build/doctrees . _build/html > junk.out 2>&1

# what is run by rtd
# sphinx-build -T -E -b readthedocs -d _build/doctrees-readthedocs -D language=en . _build/html

# my fake version
# sphinx-build -T -E -b readthedocs -d _build/doctrees-readthedocs -D language=en . _build/html > rtd.out 2>&1
