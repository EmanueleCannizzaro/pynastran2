Introduction

It'd be nice to make a Patran/FEMAP knockoff using open source tools.

Things to do:

 - read a geometry (IGES/STEP/Parasolid)
 - mesh the model
 - setup loads & boundary conditions
 - results post-processing
 - groups

Some potentially useful codes for the geometry side of things:

 - Blender
 - GMesh
 - PythonOCC
 - OpenVSP
 - FreeCAD
