 Thank you for choosing MSC.Nastran, the industry standard in FEA.
  
                    Welcome to MSC.Nastran 2005 r3.
  
 You can find version-specific online documentation, and online technical
 support at:
  
   http://www.mscsoftware.com/support/prod_support/nastran/
  
 Also at the technical support location is a searchable list of technical
 application notes and the current error/avoidance list. Please don't hesitate
 to contact your nearest technical support representative if you require
 assistance.

 MSC.Nastran 2005 r3 provides new features and enhancements in the areas of
 high performance computing, nonlinear analysis, assembly modeling,
 optimization, rotor dynamics and aeroelasticity. These include:
  
 Nonlinear
 - MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL 600) - More robust data exchange,
   faster contact (three to six-fold CPU time improvements), auto SPC and
   MSET, inertia relief, an improved out-of-core solver, expanded results
   support, automated brake squeal computations, improved fixed time stepping,
   and improved user subroutine support.
  
 Numeric Enhancements
 - A new iterative solution for static analysis. Also, significant performance
   improvements along with reduction in I/O requirements have been achieved in
   the ACMS solution.
  
 Elements
 - Arbitrary Beam Cross-Section. Enhancements include a cross-section outline
   display, stress data recovery and design optimization. The profiles can now
   be optimized using SOL 200. Stress recovery includes both torsion and shear
   terms.
 - Line Interface Elements Connects dissimilar meshes along edges. A set of
   MPC equations are internally generated to enforce the compatibility of
   displacements and rotations across the interface.
 - Three-node Beam Element. A general spatial three-node beam element for
   linear static, modal, dynamic, and buckling analyses.
 - NSML1 - Non-Structural Lumped Mass Interface Enhancement. The NSML1 entry
   single element SET specification restriction has been removed. Multiple
   element SETs can now be specified directly on the entry.
  
 Connector Elements
 - CWSEAM Element - A new seam element to connect surface patches. Extends the
1  existing CWELD and CFAST connector elements.
 - RBE2GS Element - This new element generates internal RBE2 element connecting
   a grid point pair closest to a user-defined search grid point. You can
   exclude optional grids within search radius.
  
 Dynamics and Superelements
 - Rotor Dynamics - A new general displacement and speed dependent nonlinear
   element for rotor bearings and a nonlinear squeeze film damper element.
   Also, support for the gyroscopic terms in aero solution sequences,
   non-linear harmonic response, and an easier Campbell diagram to identify
   rotor modes and track across subcases.
 - External Superelement EXTSEOUT feature. Ability to: (a) specify suffixes
   for DMIG matrices resulting from the use of the DMIGPCH option, (b) get
   output for boundary points and PLOTEL points of an external SE in the
   assembly run regardless of output requests in the external SE creation run,
   and (c) have control over the Q-set or generalized degrees of freedom (DOFs)
   of an external SE in the assembly run.
  
 Optimization
 - MSC.Nastran Topology Optimization - This release supports manufacturing
   constraints including casting (draw direction), extruding, and symmetry.
  
 Aeroelasticity
 - Monitor Points - MONPNT2 selects a specific element response for output.
   MONPNT3 outputs an integrated load on a structural subcomponent. MONDSP1
   provides averaged displacement components. All of these are available in
   SOLs 101 and 144, while SOL 146 supports MONPNT1 and MONDSP1.
 - Export and Import of Loads - The EXPORTLD Case Control command supports
   creation of a datablock that contains the external load of a user specified
   set of grids. Alternatively, export a free-body load based on the grid point
   forces of a user specified subcomponent. Loads can be imported into a
   subsequent analysis via dblocate commands, and included in the external
   load specification.
